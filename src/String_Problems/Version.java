/**
 * A version number is a string that is used to identify the unique state of a software product.
 * A version number looks like a.b.c.d, where a, b, etc are numbers, so the version number is a string
 * in which numbers are separated by dots. These numbers generally represent the hierarchy from major to minor(a is major and d is minor).
 * In this problem, we are given two version numbers. We need to compare them and conclude which one is the latest version number (that is, which version number is greater).
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * V1 = “1.0.31”
 * V2 = “1.0.27”
 * Output:  v1 is latest
 * Because V2 < V1
 * Input:
 * V1 = “1.0.10”
 * V2 = “1.0.27”
 * Output:  v2 is latest
 * Because V1 < V2
